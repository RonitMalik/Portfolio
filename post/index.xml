      <description>This was part of a personal project where a python price scrapper was built in order to track prices for specific items on amazon and then send out email alerts. The way the model works is you add a link to the amazon product and the price you&amp;rsquo;re willing to buy the product at (Target Price) and then you can run the script and it will refresh the script every 24 hours and check the price for the product, as soon as the price of the product reaches your target price the scrapper will send you an email alert.</description>

      <title>Movie Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.
The main reason behind carrying out this research was to understand how big tech companies recommend items to its users, companies like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and many more use recommendation systems to recommend items to its users on a daily basis.
Overview Recommendation system work on the principal of &amp;ldquo;homophily&amp;rdquo; which means similar users prefer similar items, this means that companies are able to accurately predict which users is most likely to buy something / watch something.</description>
